    "We use jupyter notebook for writng code and report in single file. We can compile the notebook to outcome beautiful HTML, markdown or even slides. But have you ever wondered how this all is done? Have ever felt to modify the outcome of HTML or markdown from jupyter notebook? Don't worry we will learn this all in this tutorial. We will see what jupyter notebook is made of. And how we can selectively modify the outcome of the conversion of jupter notebook to any other format.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will first understand what jupyter notebook is made of. We will read the *.ipynb* file from python and then understand its content. For this we will make one notebook file in which we will have code, markdown content, plot and some printed outcomes. This convers most of the usage of the jupyter notebook file. We will not conver how widgets and other things are output from jupyter notebook for now being.\n",

We will deeply look into this soon. ```nb1['metadata']``` contains the metadata of the jupyter notebook. These metadata can be defined in the notebook from ```Edit > Edit Notebook Metadata ``` menubar. Metadata contains the information about the type of language used and other things. We can modify thie metadata of the file. But it is not advisable (unless you know what you are doing) and required right now. This metadata is mainly used for formating and other information. This is not printed or outcome anywhere. ```nb1['nbformat']``` contains the format of the jupyter notebook. I think of it as a version of the notebook. Currently, this is 4. Similarly, ```nb1['nbformat']``` value is 5.\n",
