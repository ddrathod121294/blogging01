But have you ever wondered how this all is done? Have ever felt to modify the outcome of HTML or markdown from jupyter notebook? Don't worry we will learn this all in this tutorial. We will see what jupyter notebook is made of. And how we can selectively modify the outcome of the conversion of jupter notebook to any other format.\n",

We will not conver how widgets and other things are output from jupyter notebook for now being.\n",
